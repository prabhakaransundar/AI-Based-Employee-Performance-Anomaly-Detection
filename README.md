# AI-Based-Employee-Performance-Anomaly-Detection

Employee Performance Analysis


Project Overview
        This project analyzes employee performance using machine learning. It predicts employees at risk of low performance and visualizes insights to help HR teams make data-driven decisions.

Dataset
        The dataset includes employee information such as:

EmployeeID

Department

PerformanceScore

Attendance

Overtime

StressLevel

LeavesTaken

Note: Dataset created for demonstration purposes.

Key Features

Predicts employees at risk using Random Forest Classifier

Generates interactive and professional visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly

Shows insights like:

Department-wise low performers

Feature correlations

3D performance analysis

Technologies Used

Python 3.12

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
